## Summary of What I've Learned

I've learned the following during this project:

- The importance of starting with a wireframe.
- Documenting As I Go: The README has been a hard lession.
- Regularly Checking with W3C: A hard lession as well.
- A deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, and flexbox: But I will contin
- The value of seeking solutions and being patient.
- The educational benefit of fixing mistakes and improving over time.
- Continuous Learning.

If I had more time, I would further enhance the site with additional features and improvements.

- Enhance Site Features: Given more time, the website would benefit from added features to improve user interaction and overall experience.
- Several PNG images have been identified with issues. Specifically, images on the About.html, Contact.html, and Thanks.html pages would undergo corrections 
- The site currently has a limitation due to the lack of a dedicated server for mail. This leads to some operational challenges which would be addressed in future updates.
- Some existing issues can be quickly resolved with additional time. These will be prioritized in the next phase of development to ensure the website performs optimally across all areas.


## Project Reflections:

- GIT Usage:
I acknowledge that I haven't been utilizing GIT as effectively as I could have. My tendency to deep-dive into problem-solving often diverts my attention from proper version 
control practices. It's something I'm aware of and am working to improve.

- Procrastination & Discovery:
I delayed working on the README, but once I began, I found it enjoyable and valuable. I used ChatGPT for assistance and realized the importance of timely planning. 

- Design & Layout:
The intended use of flexbox didn't materialize as hoped. In future projects, I aim to prioritize this from the start, minimizing the need for excessive margin adjustments. I recognize there's still much to learn about HTML and CSS, and I'm committed to expanding my skills.

- Learning & Resources:
While ChatGPT proved helpful in some instances, I realized it's not always the quickest or most effective solution. I've found that search engines and YouTube tutorials often offer  
more comprehensive answers.

- Looking Forward:
I'm aware that there's room for improvement in this project. My goal was a simple design, and though I experimented with more visuals, the minimalistic approach felt right for me.

- Closing Thoughts:
My hope is that this project meets the necessary criteria. While perfection wasn't achieved, the journey offered numerous learning moments that I'll carry into future endeavors.
