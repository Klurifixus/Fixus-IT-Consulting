If you're using a tablet or a larger screen, you can also reach us through the links. You will consistently find these options in the header.

## Credits and Thanks##
 *The Love Running Project: This project provided the foundational elements for the Home page, especially crucial components like the navbar and the footer, at a time when I was still navigating my way through the development process.
 *ChatGPT: This invaluable tool provided me with advice, code samples, explanations, and indispensable grammar corrections, acting as a consistent source of guidance throughout the development journey.
 *My Girlfriend: Her unwavering support, constructive feedback, and valuable recommendations were instrumental in shaping the project. Her belief in me served as motivation to push the boundaries of what I thought I could achieve.
 *Hurtig: I am deeply grateful for the insights provided by my friend Hurtig, whose expertise as a Cloud Architect brought a unique perspective, enriching the project and guiding me in areas where I needed the most direction.
 *David Calikes portfolio-project-one: A special thank you to Cumasc Gael for laying the groundwork for this README file.
 *Pixabay: Gratitude for the free images and videos that have been incorporated into this project.
 *Unsplash: Many thanks for the complimentary images that enhanced the visuals of the project.
 *Sundeep: Immense gratitude to my mentor, Sundeep, who has been pivotal in clarifying concepts and deepening my understanding. His insights, especially regarding the Chrome DevTools, have been invaluable, saving me countless hours during the development process.


## A summary of what I have learned ##
 *I have learned the following: when I started, I didn't know much at all. This put me in a situation where I had to start over from the beginning with the website. Now, I understand how crucial and fundamentally important it is to start with a wireframe after deciding on the design of the site. I've also learned how difficult it is to summarize everything in a README at the end of the project. And believe me, I'm doing the best I can here. I've also gained a broader understanding of flexbox and the structure of HTML and CSS thanks to my mentor, Sandeep. If I had the time, I would start over and do everything right from the beginning. I've also learned to value the fact that all solutions are out there if you just ask for them. Patience and problem-solving have also been very developmental for me. If only time had been on my side, I would have preferred to redo this project to get the site fully completed according to my wishes of reatures. Spending time adjusting mistakes I made earlier has also been incredibly educational, and as I've said several times before, I just wish I had more time.

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

---

Happy coding!
